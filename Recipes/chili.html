    <h1>Chili</h1>
            <p>A longtime favorite of mine. A healthy source of fat, carbs, vitamins, protein, and fiber</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Red Kidney Beans</li>
            <li>Chili Peppers</li>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop your veggies. For super simple chili, I usually go with one medium onion, 2-3 cloves of
                 garlic, and one small red pepper. You donâ€™t need the peppers, but make sure you use the 
                 onion and garlic.</li>
            <li>Saute your veggies in a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of salt. 
                This only takes about 5 minutes. You want the onions and garlic to be soft and 
                fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add your meat, if any. This can easily be made into 4 step chili if you leave out the beef.
                 We continually change it up, using ground beef or turkey, buffalo, or even chicken. 
                 Just depends on how we are feeling. Or how hangry Mr. How Sweet is.</li>
            <li>Add your canned goods. This is another step where I normally grab what I have and throw it 
                in the pot. My favorite combination includes tomato sauce, tomato puree, tomato paste, and
                 light red kidney beans.</li>
            <li>Add your seasonings. I wish I could tell you to add a pinch of this and a dash of that, but 
                I rarely measure when it comes to chili. I will give you approximations in the recipe below,
                 but feel free to change/include/exclude depending on your personal tastes. It is YOUR chili 
                 after all.</li>
          </ol>
